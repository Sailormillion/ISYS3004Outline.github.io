     <h4>Introduction </h4>
     <pre>
         Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
         technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the      
         structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
         behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
         context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
         stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible 
         webbased applications. 
     </pre>
        <hr>
     <h4>Unit Learning Outcomes </h4>
     <pre>
         All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These
         inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
         and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
         Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
         referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
         understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
         designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
         the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.  
       
         Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities
         through the assurance of learning processes in each unit. </pre>

    <h4>Detailed information on assessment tasks</h4>
     <pre>

            <strong>1. Web Fundamentals:</strong>This is a take-home assessment. You will evaluate several websites or web
                technologies. Your critique will be submitted as an HTML document incorporating CSS to provide styling.
                Your submission will include an embedded image and link to each site critiqued. See the assignment
                handout for more information.

            <strong>2. Web Application:</strong> This is a take-home assessment. You will implement a simple website using the web
                technologies and design principles discussed throughout the semester. See the assignment handout for
                more information.

            <strong>3. Extended Learning Portfolio:</strong>This assessment is a portfolio of your work during the semester plus an
                additional task(s). You present a reflective, coherent account of the achievements and demonstrate an
                understanding of the ULO evidenced by your work during the semester. You can improve on earlier work
                and incorporate any feedback you have received during the semester before submitting the portfolio. The

     <h4>Assessment Moderation</h4>

<pre>
     <strong>Fair assessment through moderation</strong> 
     Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning
     outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation
     of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from
     <a href="https://policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/">https://policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/</a>

     <strong>Pre-marking moderation</strong>
     A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and
     confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking
     criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to
     ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.

     <strong>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</strong>
     The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit:
</pre>
     <ul> <li><pre>Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries</pre></li></ul>
     <ul> <li><pre>Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where
     students have not met the pass requirements</pre></li></ul>
     <ul> <li><pre>Analysis of the variances between markers and locations</pre></li></ul>
     <ul> <li><pre>Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards</pre></li></ul>
<pre>
     <strong>Late assessment</strong>
     Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in this unit.

     Where a late assessment is permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the Assessment
     Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:

        1. For assessment items submitted within the first 24 hours after the due date/time, students will be penalised
           by a deduction of 5% of the total marks allocated for the assessment task;
 
        2. For each additional 24 hour period commenced an additional penalty of 10% of the total marks allocated
           for the assessment item will be deducted; and

        3. Assessment items submitted more than 168 hours late (7 calendar days) will receive a mark of zero.


     Where late assessment is NOT permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the
     Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:

        1. All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will receive a mark of zero.
</pre>
<hr> 
    <br><br><br><br>
 <hr>
 <h4>Assessment extension</h4>
 <pre>
     Where an application for an assessment extension <strong>is</strong> permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit (refer to
     the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):

        1. A student who is unable to complete an assessment item by/on the due date/time as a result of exceptional
           circumstances beyond the student's control, may apply for an assessment extension on the Assessment
           Extension Application Form as prescribed by the Academic Registrar. The form is available on the Forms
           page at <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/students/essentials/forms-documents/forms/">https://www.curtin.edu.au/students/essentials/forms-documents/forms/</a> and also within the student's
           OASIS (My Studies tab – Quick Forms) account.
        2. The student will be expected to submit their application for an Assessment Extension with supporting
           documentation <a href="https://students.connect.curtin.edu.au/app/assessment_extension">via online forms</a>.
        3. Timely submission of this information supports the assessment process. For applications that are declined,
           delayed submission may have significant ramifications on the possible marks awarded.
        4. An application may be accepted up to five working days after the due date/time of the assessment item
           where the student is able to provide a verifiable explanation as to why they were not able to submit the
           application prior to the assessment due date/time

     Where an application for an assessment extension <strong>is NOT</strong> permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit
     (refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):
        1. All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will be subject to late penalties or receive a mark of
           zero depending on the unit permitting late assessment submissions.

     <h4>Reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities/health circumstances likely to impact on studies</h4>
     <pre>
     <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/students/personal-support/disability/cap/">A Curtin Access Plan</a> (CAP) is a document that outlines the type and level of support required by a student with a
     disability or health condition to have equitable access to their studies at Curtin. Carers for people with disability
     may also be eligible for support. This support can include alternative exam or test arrangements, study materials
     in accessible formats, access to Curtin's facilities and services or other support as discussed with an advisor from
     <a href="https://www.curtin.edu.au/students/personal-support/disability/">AccessAbility Services</a>.

     Documentation is required from your treating Health Professional to confirm your health circumstances or carer
     responsibilities.
