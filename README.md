Hi , this is ReadMe file ^^
I understand that the assigment have been done quite bad, as i didn't spend enough time on it. I'm not feeling well for the last few days because of getting a booster shot, 
but I haven't asked for an extension as you have already changed the due date twice. 
I fully understand that it's my fault for starting this assessment at the very last moment, so I'm sorry for causing trouble (it's just trouble for me ('.') )
Referring to the code, I haven't used any tools/generators/templates as it was a requirement to show our basic skills that we have learned from the course so far. 
As we can see, I'm lack in JavaScript code, which i will still work on before the next assigment and include the reflection work on it to my Extended Learning Portfolio at the end of the semester. 
I realized only after submission that you were asking for a specific code to switch themes, before i though we can include any Java Sccript code , as long as it will apply some changes excluding buttons.
So I decided to add bluring before the page will load, but as you can see it was failed. The idea was taken from the Traversy Media YouTube channel "Build 5 projects with HTML, CSS & JavaScript"
In the CSS file i still need to work on images, you might noticed that when you scrolling down the page, the images of the tables going up as well, I'm not sure how to fix that yet. 
Also I need to work on Boarders a bit more 
In html file i need to finish some links. Instead of creating tables through HTML, i've used the images of them, as it was faster and easier, 
however I still included the small table created with HTML to demonstrate the basic skill. 
The overall time spent on assigment is 7-10 hours, and I understand that it wasn't enough and it's fully my fault. 
To work on that assigment I have referred to w3school, Dave Gray, Dani Krossing YouTube channels. 
All the reflection work I will include in the Extended Learning Portfolio 
(\^.^/)
